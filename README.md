This is a standalone html/javascript app for interactively building image clusters for use in Open Drone Map. It aims to solve an issue with the internal splitting algorithm when working with highly oblique images. The picture on the ground with these images will be offset from xy coordinate position of the drone. This app will correctly cluster these images based on the geographic center of the image footprints and not on the camera position. This offset is calculated from gimbal angle the DJI altitude obove ground information.
